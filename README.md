## This is my project from Duke AIPI510 course. We want to give a reasonable ranking of the 25 apartments we collect. The factors of our ranking includes prime, price, distance to fastfood locations, distance to supermarket locations and distance to Duke university. The project code ipynb file shows all the code we need to output the final ranking. The visualization ipynb file shows how we visualize all the locations.
